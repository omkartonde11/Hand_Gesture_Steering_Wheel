# Hand_Gesture_Steering_Wheel
Hi guys , this is our 6th Sem College Project
In this a framework for human hand movement recognition is implemented for users to use/play a driving simulator/game with more immersion and accuracy using a webcam.
Here the user shall make hand gesture in a way such that you are using a real car’s steering wheel. Our module will use the webcam to capture the hand’s/fist’s coordinates by calculating the slope whenever the user’s hand gesture gets tilted either left or right, the vehicle in simulator/game will turn accordingly.


Import the necessary libraries:
 OpenCV for image processing and video capture ( pip install opencv-python )
 Mediapipe for hand tracking ( pip install mediapipe ) 
 Pydirectinput and Directinput for simulating keyboard and joystick input (pip install PyDirectInput )
 Time for timing the program
